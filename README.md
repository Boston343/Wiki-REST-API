# Wiki REST API

REST API for a basic Wiki site. This uses Express, EJS, and Mongoose.

Homepage is at `localhost:3000`. You can create posts at `localhost:3000/compose` which then populate on the homepage. You can also type in `localhost:/3000/posts/postTitle` where "postTitle" is the title of a post seen on the homepage (created on the compose page), and that post will be rendered alone in the window.

-   Node modules - inside project run `npm install`
    -   express
